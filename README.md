#Notes

From the instruction in readme, I tried endlessly to understand the result page requirement but I couldn't; So I did a table showing result through email instead. The part I couldn't understand is is conntained in the line below:

---------------------------------------------------
- There are four dimensions to an MBTI test
    - EI - Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I)
    - SN - Sensing (S) or Intuition (N)
    - TF - Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)
    - JP - Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)
- Each question will determine where a user falls in one of the particular dimensions
    - This is defined per question by the Dimension column on the spreadsheet
        - The direction that the user leans is defined by the Direction and Meaning Columns
    - The result of an MBTI test looks at each of the 4 dimensions and determines which side the user leans
- The end result is the top letter for each dimension
    - If a user leans:
        - Extraversion (E) in the Extraversion/Introversion (E/I) Dimension
        - Intuition (N) in the Sensing/Intuition (S/N) Dimension
        - Thinking (T) in the Thinking/Feeling (T/F) Dimension
        - Perceiving (P) in the Judging/Perceiving (J/P) Dimension
    - Their end result will be: ENTP (Extraversion Intuition Thinking Perceiving)
	
    - If a user's responses to a dimension are perfectly balanced (they don't lean more to one side or another) the algorithm should default to the first option on the list 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    If you need me impement it just as contained, kindly provide a clearer explanation of this pasted section above to me.
    Thanks.
